                Tie It Up
            </h1>
            <p>
                  Definitely, men use neckties for many reasons, beyond style or fashion look. Men feel comfortable with a nice suit, a watch and an amazing pair of shoes, but what gives them the confidence and power are the ties. So, today we present you the 4 important reasons to wear a tie.
                  Personal Branding:
                  It’s not just about looking good and introducing yourself like a shining brand, because you’re more than that. It’s about making fit the proper outfit with yourself.
                  This is where the tie clicks with your presentation, with whom you really are and where you’re going. The more professional you look, your personal branding will show people what you do and how much you love doing it.
                  Dream your future
            <p>
                  For sure you have many dreams to fulfill, so you’d better prepared. I mean that, if you have in mind the job of your dreams, why not start adapting to it. Dress as if you had already the job that you want. Show to your superiors who you are and what you want.
                  Surely with a nice suit and your best tie (Korβáta’s of course) you will shock everybody. Your appearance says a lot about you and your mood. Thus the popular saying; “Dress for the job you want and not the one you have.”
                  Be the example:
                  Who doesn’t like to be the positive example in a group discussion? This is a great stimulus, and also you can motivate to other people with your acts. It´s not about teaching others how to dress or giving them fashion tips, it´s about showing people the importance of dressing properly and the great things you can get with it. There’s nothing better than using a nice suit and a nice tie.
                  Looking good

             Divide It Up
        </h1>            
        <p>
               Succinctly, pi—which is written as the Greek letter for p, or π—is the ratio of the circumference of any circle to the diameter of that circle. Regardless of the circle's size, this ratio will always equal pi. In decimal form, the value of pi is approximately 3.14. But pi is an irrational number, meaning that its decimal form neither ends (like 1/4 = 0.25) nor becomes repetitive (like 1/6 = 0.166666...). (To only 18 decimal places, pi is 3.141592653589793238.) Hence, it is useful to have shorthand for this ratio of circumference to diameter. According to Petr Beckmann's A History of Pi, the Greek letter π was first used for this purpose by William Jones in 1706, probably as an abbreviation of periphery, and became standard mathematical notation roughly 30 years later.
               Try a brief experiment: Using a compass, draw a circle. Take one piece of string and place it on top of the circle, exactly once around. Now straighten out the string; its length is called the circumference of the circle. Measure the circumference with a ruler. Next, measure the diameter of the circle, which is the length from any point on the circle straight through its center to another point on the opposite side. (The diameter is twice the radius, the length from any point on the circle to its center.) If you divide the circumference of the circle by the diameter, you will get approximately 3.14—no matter what size circle you drew! A larger circle will have a larger circumference and a larger radius, but the ratio will always be the same. If you could measure and divide perfectly, you would get 3.141592653589793238..., or pi.
               Otherwise said, if you cut several pieces of string equal in length to the diameter, you will need a little more than three of them to cover the circumference of the circle.

               Pi is most commonly used in certain computations regarding circles. Pi not only relates circumference and diameter. Amazingly, it also connects the diameter or radius of a circle with the area of that circle by the formula: the area is equal to pi times the radius squared. Additionally, pi shows up often unexpectedly in many mathematical situations. For example, the sum of the infinite series
               1 + 1/4 + 1/9 + 1/16 + 1/25 + ... + 1/n2 + ... is π2/6
               he importance of pi has been recognized for at least 4,000 years. A History of Pi notes that by 2000 B.C., "the Babylonians and the Egyptians (at least) were aware of the existence and significance of the constant π," recognizing that every circle has the same ratio of circumference to diameter. Both the Babylonians and Egyptians had rough numerical approximations to the value of pi, and later mathematicians in ancient Greece, particularly Archimedes, improved on those approximations. By the start of the 20th century, about 500 digits of pi were known. With computation advances, thanks to computers, we now know more than the first six billion digits of pi.

                By definition, an entrepreneur is a person who organizes and operates a business and is willing to take on greater than normal financial risks in order to do so. Practically speaking, an entrepreneur is required to wear many hats including Chief Revenue Officer. One of the key aspects of being an entrepreneur and operating a business is the ability to conduct Business Development. Creating Revenue through sales is the ultimate Catalyst for any entrepreneurial endeavor. The existence of sales place important aspect in many ways for an organization. 
                Sales equates to revenue and revenue covers expenses. The ability of a business to cover its expenses create stable operations and the opportunity for growth. Without sales the organization will often struggle and have a difficult time attracting talent and actually growing the business.
                
            <p>
                Sales appears as the top line number of any financial document and usually gives an indication as to the health of the organization. Watch an episode of Shark Tank and you will hear the number one asked question, "How much have you done in sales?" Investors will always want to understand the revenue model that is in place for a business and also to see if there is any traction in the organization to demonstrate the ability to have cash flow, and possibly increase of cash flow. 
            </p>    
            <p>
                Sales do another thing for an organization; It creates a system, or process for growth. When an entrepreneur is able to define the method by which they identify a customer, present to the customer, and are able to close the customer in a duplicatable and scalable manner, then they can build a sales team around this process. Most often an entrepreneur will figure out this process internally through a trial and error method to build the sales funnel for their organization. When resources are available, it is valuable to bring an organization such as Paradigm 5 who assists with building the sales funnel and a sales department. According to its founder, Charlie Winn, "Selling is always a critical component of being an entrepreneur because there are never any guarantees in either endeavor. Thus, the ability to deal with that uncertainty and move forward towards defined goals is a skill that directly transfers." Once this is established, it is a matter of resources in order togrowthecompany. 
            </p>
            <p>               
                Sales is based on an individual's ability to connect and influence another decision-maker. An entrepreneur must, as Stu Heinecke talks about in his book How to Get a Meeting with Anyone, first identify the person who is the CEO (Center of Enterprise Opportunity). Then create a strategy for connecting with them. Through this connection, a relationship can be established. Ultimately a sale can be made based on the perceived or actual value provided by the entrepreneur.

                Definitely, men use neckties for many reasons, beyond style or fashion look. Men feel comfortable with a nice suit, a watch and an amazing pair of shoes, but what gives them the confidence and power are the ties. So, today we present you the 4 important reasons to wear a tie.
                Personal Branding:
                It’s not just about looking good and introducing yourself like a shining brand, because you’re more than that. It’s about making fit the proper outfit with yourself.
                This is where the tie clicks with your presentation, with whom you really are and where you’re going. The more professional you look, your personal branding will show people what you do and how much you love doing it.
                Dream your future

                For sure you have many dreams to fulfill, so you’d better prepared. I mean that, if you have in mind the job of your dreams, why not start adapting to it. Dress as if you had already the job that you want. Show to your superiors who you are and what you want.
                Surely with a nice suit and your best tie (Korβáta’s of course) you will shock everybody. Your appearance says a lot about you and your mood. Thus the popular saying; “Dress for the job you want and not the one you have.”
                Be the example:
                Who doesn’t like to be the positive example in a group discussion? This is a great stimulus, and also you can motivate to other people with your acts. It´s not about teaching others how to dress or giving them fashion tips, it´s about showing people the importance of dressing properly and the great things you can get with it. There’s nothing better than using a nice suit and a nice tie.
                Looking good
